#instead of inheriting from the forms.Forms class, we will use forms.ModelForm in our forms.py file.
#This helper class allows us to create a form from a pre-existing model
#We then add an inline class (something we haven’t seen before) called Meta
#This Meta class provides information connecting the model to the form.

eg :

from django import forms
from myapp.models import MyModel
class MyNewForm(forms.ModelForm):
	# Form Fields go here
		class Meta:
			model = MyModel
        fields = # Let’s see the options!
#thinking about security no need to add form form filds out side meta Class
# if you want custom validators then fields must be set outside meta Class

#setting the fields to ModelForm
option 1) Set it to “__all__”

from django import forms
from myapp.models import MyModel
class MyNewForm(forms.ModelForm):
	# Form Fields go here
		class Meta:
			model = MyModel
        fields = “__all__”

option 2) exclude certain fields
from django import forms
from myapp.models import MyModel
class MyNewForm(forms.ModelForm):
	# Form Fields go here
		class Meta:
			model = MyModel
        exclude = [“field1”,“field2”]

option 3) List included fields
from django import forms
from myapp.models import MyModel
class MyNewForm(forms.ModelForm):
	# Form Fields go here
		class Meta:
			model = MyModel
        fields = (“field1”,“field2”)
