We will be using the same ProTwo from Django Level One

Here is what you have to do:
Add a new model called User
It should have these fields:
First Name
Last Name
Email

Make sure to make the migrations!

Then create a script that will populate your database with fake Users.

Then confirm the populating through the Admin interface.

Then create a view for your website for the domain extension /users

This /users page will be an HTML list of the user names and emails

You will use template tags to generate this content from the User model.

Remember to change your urls.py files to deal with the changes to the /users extension!
