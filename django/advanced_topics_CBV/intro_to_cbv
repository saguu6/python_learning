#Letâ€™s convert a simple hello world function view into a class based view!
#We will use the simplest available Django View Class:
from django.views.generic import View

class CBView(View):
    def get(self,request):
        return HttpResponse("CLASS BASED VIEWS")

#We will also have to slightly change the way we call a class based view in the urls.py file of our project.
#We need to add in a .as_view() call off the class, this is an inherited method from the View we mentioned earlier.

url(r'^$',views.CBView.as_view())
