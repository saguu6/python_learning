#Often when we have models, we want to either list the records from the model, or show details of a single record.
#Previously we did this with calls using the Object Relation Mapper directly
This included things like:
MyModel.objects.all()
#However these sort of operations are very common!

#So common that Django has some generic view classes you can inherit to very quickly display information from your model.
#This is where the power of CBV comes to help us out!

#Previously we’ve been putting all our templates inside the templates folder within the matching app folder.
#However it is also common practice to do the “reverse”, have a template folder inside the app’s folder.
