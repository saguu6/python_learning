#Imagine that you had some information from your model that you wished to use across various views/pages.
#But perhaps you wanted to make a slight edit to the information before injecting it, like string operations, or arithmetic.

#implement template filters that allow you to effect the injection before displaying it to the user.
#This allows for flexibility from a single source!

#The general form for a template filter is:
{{ value | filter:”parameter” }}
#Not all filters take in parameters.
#Many of these filters are based off of common built-in Python functions so you will be already familiar with them!
