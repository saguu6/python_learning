#How can we replace a hardcoded URL path in an href with a URL Template?

#We can easily fix this with the use of URLs in our templates. For example:
<a href=”basicapp/thankyou”>Thanks</a>
#Can be changed to:
<a href=”{% url ‘thanku’%}”>Thanks</a>
name=‘thanku’ is in the urls.py file.

#Could also just directly reference the view. For example:
<a href=”basicapp/thankyou”>
Thanks</a>
#Can be changed to:
<a href=”{% url‘basicapp.views.thankyou’%}”>
   Thanks</a>

#The suggested (and most future-proof) method to do all of this involves the urls.py file.
#Inside the urls.py file  you add in the variable app_name
#You then set this variable equal to a string that is the same as your app name
#This is the best way to use URL templates:
<a href=”basicapp/thankyou”>Thanks</a>
#Can be changed to:
#this method will be used in future
<a href=”{% url ‘basicapp:thankyou’ %}”>   Thanks</a> #there should not be any space between the quotes when the app_name:name_of_url
#This method requires that app_name variable to be created inside the urls.py file!

#Using templates for relative URLs will really help with multiple applications.
