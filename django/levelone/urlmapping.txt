3URL MAPPING IS DONE IN 'first_project'
#For url mapping

#use include() functions
The include() function allows us to look for a match with regular expressions and link back to our application’s own urls.py file.
We will have to manually add in this urls.py file in APLLICATION

So we would add the following to the project’s urls.py

from django.conf.urls import include
urlpatterns = [url(r’^first_app/’,include(‘first_app.urls’))]

This would allow us to look for any url that has the pattern:
www.domainname.com/first_app/…
If we match that pattern, the include() function basically tells Django to go look at the urls.py file inside of first_app folder
