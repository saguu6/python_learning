#when we’ve logged on to the Admin page we’ve seen that there is already a built-in Authentication and Authorization model set in place.

#The User object has a few key features:
Username
Email
Password
First Name
Surname --> last_name

#There are also some other attributes for the User object, such as is_active, is_staff, is_superuser.
#Sometimes you will also want to add more attributes to a user, such as their own links or a profile image.

#You can do this in your applications models.py file by creating another class that has a relationship to the User class.

#Notice a new field we haven’t seen yet, an ImageField.
#This will allow you to store images to a model, typically we will keep any user uploaded content like this in the media file.

#In order to work with images with Python we will need to install the Python Imaging Library with:
pip install pillow

#Some users may get an error on this command indicating something like jpeg support disabled, in which case use:
pip install pillow --global-option=”build_ext”
--global-option=”--disable-jpeg”

#Once you’ve created this model you’ll have to remember to register it in the admin.py file, with something like:
admin.site.register(UserProfileInfo)

#Typically images, CSS, JS, etc. all go in the static folder of your project, with the STATIC_ROOT variable path defined inside of settings.py
#User uploaded content will go to the media folder, with the MEDIA_ROOT.
