#A lot of the coding for working with Users and Authorization happens in the views.py file.
#The basic idea is that we check if there is a POST request and then perform some sort of action based off that information.

#Sometimes we will want to save that information directly to the database.
#Other times, we will set commit=False so we can manipulate the data before saving it to the database.
#This helps prevent collision errors.
